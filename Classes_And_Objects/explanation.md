# Classes and Objects - HackerRank Solution

## Problem Overview
This problem demonstrates fundamental object-oriented programming concepts including classes, objects, methods, and attributes.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### Input → Processing → Output

**Input:**
- Student information (name, roll number)
- Multiple subject marks for each student

**Processing:**
1. **Class Definition**: Create a `Student` class with attributes and methods
2. **Constructor**: Initialize student with name, roll number, and empty marks list
3. **Methods**: Add methods for adding marks, calculating average, determining grade
4. **Object Creation**: Create multiple student objects
5. **Data Manipulation**: Add marks and perform calculations

**Output:**
- Display complete student information including name, roll number, marks, average, and grade

## Key Python Concepts Used
- **Classes and Objects**: Basic OOP structure
- **Attributes**: Instance variables (name, roll_number, marks)
- **Methods**: Instance methods for operations
- **Constructor**: `__init__` method for initialization
- **Data Encapsulation**: Grouping related data and methods

## Learning Points
- Classes are blueprints for creating objects
- Objects are instances of classes with their own data
- Methods define behavior of objects
- Attributes store object state
- Always use `self` to refer to instance variables and methods
