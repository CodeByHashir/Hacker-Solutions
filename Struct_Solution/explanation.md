# Struct Solution - HackerRank Solution

## Problem Overview
This problem demonstrates how to create struct-like data structures in Python using classes, which is Python's equivalent to C/C++ structs.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### Input → Processing → Output

**Input:**
- Data for creating student and point objects

**Processing:**
1. **Class Definition**: Create classes to represent structured data
2. **Constructor**: Initialize objects with multiple attributes
3. **Methods**: Add functionality to the data structures
4. **String Representation**: Implement __str__ and __repr__ methods
5. **Object Creation**: Create multiple instances of the classes

**Output:**
- Display structured data and calculated results

## Key Python Concepts Used
- **Classes as Structs**: Using classes to group related data
- **Constructor**: __init__ method for initialization
- **Instance Variables**: Attributes that store data
- **Methods**: Functions that operate on the data
- **String Representation**: __str__ and __repr__ methods
- **Mathematical Operations**: Distance calculations

## Learning Points
- Python classes can serve as struct-like data structures
- Classes provide both data storage and behavior
- __str__ method controls how objects are displayed
- __repr__ method provides detailed representation
- Methods can perform calculations on the stored data
- Classes are more powerful than simple structs
