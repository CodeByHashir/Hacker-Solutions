## How to Use This Repository

### For Beginners
1. **Start with Easy Problems**: Begin with problems marked as "Easy" to build confidence
2. **Read the Explanation First**: Each problem has a detailed `explanation.md` file that breaks down the solution step-by-step
3. **Study the Code**: Look at the `solution.py` file to understand the implementation
4. **Practice**: Try to solve similar problems on your own
5. **Experiment**: Modify the code to see how different approaches work

### For Intermediate Learners
1. **Focus on Concepts**: Use the "Python Concepts Used" column to identify areas for improvement
2. **Compare Solutions**: Look at different approaches to the same problem
3. **Optimize**: Try to improve the solutions or implement them differently
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Add your own test cases to verify the solutions

### Learning Path Recommendation
1. **Start Here**: Conditional Statement → For Loop → Functions
2. **OOP Basics**: Classes and Objects → Rectangle Area → Struct Solution
3. **Advanced OOP**: Inheritance Introduction → Multi-Level Inheritance → Virtual Function
4. **Special Topics**: String → Box It → Pointer

## Key Features
